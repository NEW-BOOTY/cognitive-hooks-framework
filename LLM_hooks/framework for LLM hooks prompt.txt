Prompt: 
Design and implement an original, brand new modular framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to connect to external tools and reasoning systems in more flexible, controllable ways. These "hooks" must extend capabilities beyond prompting or fine‑tuning, making models more adaptable and enterprise‑ready.

Requirements:
1. Language Hooks Framework: Implement hooks as modular attachments that decouple tool usage from the model itself. Avoid hard‑coded integrations; instead, allow dynamic connections to APIs, databases, or reasoning modules.
2. Augmented Reasoning: Create hooks that enable multi‑step reasoning, fact‑checking, and specialized tasks by calling external logic rather than relying solely on internal weights.
3. Multimodal Expansion: Develop original hooks that connect LLMs to vision, audio, or robotics systems, enabling richer multimodal workflows.
4. Enterprise Integration: Standardize hooks so LLMs can plug into business systems for compliance, monetization, and orchestration across cloud platforms.
5. Ethical Safeguards: Route sensitive queries through vetted hooks (e.g., fact‑checkers, bias filters) to mitigate misinformation, bias, or toxicity.
6. Ultra Extreme Error Handling: Incorporate correcting and self‑healing mechanisms to counteract challenges such as:
   - Complexity: Address latency and orchestration overhead.
   - Security: Enforce strict sandboxing and authentication when exposing hooks to external systems.
   - Standardization: Create real‑world common protocols to prevent fragmentation across vendors.
7. On‑Demand Capabilities: Hooks must allow attaching capabilities like “fact‑check,” “query database,” or “run simulation” without retraining models for each new task.
8. Cognitive OS Shift: Ensure the framework transitions LLMs from monolithic architectures toward modular cognitive operating systems, complete with compliance gates, monetization scaffolds, and agent orchestration.

Manifesto Prompt:
We stand at the threshold of a new era in artificial intelligence. The age of monolithic LLMs is ending, and the dawn of modular cognitive operating systems is here. Our mission is to create original frameworks of "hooks" — dynamic, flexible attachments that empower language models to transcend their limitations.

These hooks are not mere integrations. They are gateways to augmented reasoning, enabling fact‑checking, multi‑step logic, and specialized tasks through external modules. They are bridges to multimodal expansion, connecting language models to vision, audio, and robotics for richer human‑machine collaboration. They are standards for enterprise integration, ensuring compliance, monetization, and orchestration across every cloud platform. They are guardians of ethics, routing sensitive queries through vetted safeguards to protect truth and trust.

We embrace complexity with ultra extreme error handling, correcting and self‑healing in real time. We confront security with strict sandboxing and authentication. We demand standardization to unify protocols and prevent fragmentation. And we insist on adaptability: hooks that attach capabilities like “fact‑check,” “query database,” or “run simulation” on demand, without retraining.

This is not an incremental improvement. It is a paradigm shift — from static models to living systems, from closed architectures to open orchestration, from fragile prototypes to legally defensible, monetizable platforms. This is the future of AI, engineered with originality, compliance, and vision.
